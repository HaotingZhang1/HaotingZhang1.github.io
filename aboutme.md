title: About me
---

I am Haoting Zhang, a PhD student under the 2020 Cohort of the <a href="https://www.hdruk.ac.uk/careers-in-health-data-science/further-education/phd-programme//">HDR UK-Turing Wellcome PhD Programme in Health Data Science</a>, currently based at <a href="https://mlatcl.github.io">ML@CL</a>, <a href="https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk">Department of Computer Science and Technology</a>, University of Cambridge. I am supervised by Carl Henrik Ek, Marta Milo and Magnus Rattray. Previously, I attended the University of Oxford for my undergraduate study in Mathematics and Statistics, before studying for a Master's degree in Machine Learning at UCL.

Through my study, I have developed interest in approaching healthcare challenges with probabilistic and/or generative models in machine learning. I believe they have the potential to be utilised in healthcare because they provide routes to inserting prior knowledge, interpreting results and estimating uncertainty, which are all crucial aspects in healthcare application. However, many gaps remain to be filled, and I am generally interested in tackling these challenges.

Outside of research, I am passionate about motorsports. I follow Formula One races, and I enjoy doing some indoor karting in a casual manner from time to time.

I am also owned by a ginger cat (yes, you read it right). Here is a picture of my boss:
