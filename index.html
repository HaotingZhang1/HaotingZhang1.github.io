</p>I am Haoting Zhang, a PhD student under the 2020 Cohort of the <a href="https://www.hdruk.ac.uk/careers-in-health-data-science/further-education/phd-programme//">HDR UK-Turing Wellcome PhD Programme in Health Data Science</a>, currently based at <a href="https://mlatcl.github.io">ML@CL</a>, <a href="https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk">Department of Computer Science and Technology</a>, University of Cambridge. I am supervised by Carl Henrik Ek, Marta Milo and Magnus Rattray. Previously, I attended the University of Oxford for my undergraduate study in Mathematics and Statistics, before studying for a Master's degree in Machine Learning at UCL.

</p>For my PhD thesis, I am working on modelling, optimisation and active learning of drug combinations from a Bayesian perspective. In the first phase of the thesis, we estimated the synergy of the drug combinations using a Bayesian framework so that parameter uncertainty can be estimated and existing knowledge can be inserted through the priors. In particular, we developed SynBa, a flexible Bayesian approach to estimate the uncertainty of the synergistic efficacy and potency of drug combinations, so that actionable decisions can be derived from the model outputs:

I am delighted that this work has been accepted for presentation at the ISMB/ECCB 2023 Conference. I will present the work during the conference to be held in July in Lyon, France.

</p>Prior to this, I worked jointly on multi-partition clustering of high-dimensional data (in particular images) through variational autoencoders with a hierarchy of latent variables, each with a Mixture-of-Gaussians prior. This work has been accepted at NeurIPS 2021:
